## {{ page.title }}

You are far off of the main road when you see a small band of Inox approaching
from the west.  You try to divert your path to go around them, but they are moving
directly into your path.

In a few minutes' time, they overtake you.

"You've wandered into our territory, travelers," the biggest one says. "We don't
much like visitors."

You stare at her blankly.

"Such acts can be forgiven, but it will cost you."

## Option A

Try to reason with the Inox.

## Option B

Fight off the Inox.  They'll get no payments from you.

***

## B

You raise your weapons and state that no payments will be made this day.  The group of Inox
snarls and attacks.  After you land a few solid blows, though, they break off and run away
back to the west, leaving you to tend to your wounds.

<strong>All start scenario with 3 damage.</strong>
