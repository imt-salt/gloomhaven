## Introduction

After finding evidence of a great, vibrant tree that rests in the heart of the Lingering
Swamp and learning that it has unique healing properties, you head to the south to see the
thing for yourself.

When you locate it, however, the scene is not at all what you expected. Amidst poisonous
waters, the giant tree stands ablaze. A number of drakes and other dark creatures scurry around it.

“It’s a mating ritual,” an old Inox woman says as she approaches you in a panic. “I’ve seen
it up north. The drakes burn down trees as a show of their strength, but...but that tree
is sacred. Please, you must do something! If the tree dies, my village will have no way to sustain itself.”

## Special Rules

Set up the tree [A] at the beginning of the scenario. It has 17 hit points and suffers 2 damage
at the end of every round, even before its room is revealed. After its room is revealed,
if there are no Rending Drakes on the [M] tile at the end of around, it does not suffer damage. It can
be healed like any normal ally once it is revealed, but the tree cannot be affected by any
other abilities. If the tree is destroyed, the scenario is lost.

## Conclusion

With the final creature destroyed, you are finally able to turn your attention to the tree
and put out the blaze. It is heavily charred, but it should survive.

“I cannot thank you enough for what you have done, strangers,” the old Inox says. “I don’t
know why you showed up when you did, but I believe it was the work of the spirits. You are a miracle!”

The woman scratches her head. “I cannot fathom what would cause drakes to travel so far south,
though. Perhaps there is something working against the spirits as well.”

She hands you a couple of potions. “In any case, please take these as a token of my thanks.
My tribe extracts the healing powers of the tree to make them. I hope they are of some use to you.”
