# Gloomhaven
{: .gloomfont}

Everyone needs to eat.

Whatever your reason for coming to Gloomhaven, out here on the edge of the world,
that simple fact is never going to change. A mercenary can’t fight on an empty stomach.

So when Jekserah, a Valrath woman wearing a red cloak and enough gold jewelry to keep
you fed for a decade, approaches you in the Sleeping Lion and offers to pay you ten
gold coins to track down a thief and retrieve some stolen goods...well, it seems like
as good an excuse as any to sober up and start paying off your tab.

“This thief has taken some important documents,” says the red-skinned merchant, her
tail whipping about in agitation. “I don’t care what you do to him. Just bring back what is mine.”

Based on Jekserah’s description, it was easy enough to knock around a few alley thugs
and get a location of the thieves’ hideout. You don’t find yourself as a mercenary way
out in Gloomhaven without knowing how to crack a few skulls.

So your target is the Black Barrow. Sounds like a lovely place.
