## {{ page.title }}
{: .gloomfont}

Walking among the foothilss, you see a steep ridge in front of you, and on top of it,
 a very odd rock formation.

The formation calls to you somehow, but the way up is not readily apparent.  In fact,
climbing the ridge looks pretty dangerous, but you just feel like you need to get up there
and look at the rocks.

## Option A

Take the risk to climb the ridge and investigate the rocks.

## Option B

Forget about the roks and continue on you journey.

***

## A

Fearing the possibility of falling from a great heat, you choose your steps carefully.
Still, the climb to the top takes a long time and is exhausting.  Reaching the top, you
approach the unnatural rock formation, a giant mound of stones stacked one on top of
another.  At the base of the bottom stone, you see the following etched with charcoal:

[SPOILER](THE RUINS OF THE DEEP TAKE SHAPE.)
