You are walking across the Silent Bridge, headed toward the Sleeping Lion to get a quick
meal, when you see a Quatryl standing in front of a small cart laden with plates of food
and curious contraptions.

"Come try the delicacies of the East!" the Quatryl barks.  "Good enhanced with science!
Flavors beyond your wildest imagination!"

## Option A

Stop and try the food.

## Option B

Continue on your way to a less adventurous meal.

***

## A

You decide to indulge in the unknown and see what the Quatryl is offering.  He looks
very pleased at your approach and instructs you to inhale a tube of vapors, then take
a bite from a bowl full of tiny golden spheres.  As the spheres melt in your mouth, the
taste mixes with the aroma of the vapors to create a wonderful experience.  You pay what
you can, but the Quatryl seems soley focused on how much you enjoyed the meal.

<strong>All start scenario with BLESS.</strong>
<strong>Lose 3 gold each.</strong>
