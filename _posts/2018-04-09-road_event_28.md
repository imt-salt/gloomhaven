As you walk down a dirt path, you see a hard-looking mercenary sitting in
a patch of grass.  He nods as you pass.

"Hey, friends," he says.  There is something off about his tone though.

"I don't suppose one of you might be willing to part with a stamina potion,
would you?  I'm heading toward Gloomhaven, but I've just come such a long way,
and I'm not feeling too good about the stretch I have left."

With the clank of his sword sheath against his armour and a loud groan, the
man stands up.  "I'll pay you well for it."


## Option A

Sell the man a stamina potion.

## Option B

Politely decline and move quickly on your way.

***

## B

There was something off-putting about that man.  You are more than happy
to move along and put some distance between you.

<strong>No effect.</strong>
