Having recently returned from your latest adventure, you are approached
by a ratty-looking boy in tears.

"Please, sirs, could you please help me with my cat?  He went over there,
and I'm afraid." The boy points a dirty finger at a decrepit, abandoned building.
"I don't know what else to do."

## Option A

Find a cat?  You have more important things to do.

## Option B

Reassure the boy and go find the cat.

***

## A

You shake your head and direct the boy to go find his mother.  With any luck
she will knock some sense into him so that he stops troubling strangers
with such trivial matters.

<strong>No effect.</strong>
