Occasionally your dealings in town lead you past the bustling docks.
All conversation gets drowned out by the constant din of loading and
unloading cargo and crew.  This makes it all the more surprising when
you hear a voice above the noise directed straight at you.

"Oi!  You with the hard looks and big arms!  I desperately need some
help o'er here!  Spare a few minutes to help make sure I get out of port
on time?  Otherwise I'll be stuck here until tomorrow."

## Option A

Help the captain load his ship

## Option B

Move on with your business.  You don't have the time or inclination for such things.

***

## A

What was advertised as a few minutes turns out to be an hour or two as you lug
large crates full of some foul-smelling liquid from a nearby warehouse into
the hold of the ship.  At least the captain is relieved that he'll be able to set
sail on time though.  He gratefully pays you, but you can't help but think that such
menial labor might be beneath you.

<strong>Gain 5 gold each.</strong>
