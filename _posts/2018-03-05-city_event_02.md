## City Event #02
{: .gloomfont}

As the daylight fades, you find yourselves wandering through a half-crowded
market street, browsing wares.

"Hey! Over here!" You turn in the direction of the voice to see a filthy
Vermling gesturing from a dark alley.  "Yeah, you grim-looking chaps.  I
have something you might be interested in."

The Vermling holds out a piece of metal covered in sludge.  "Found this in
the sewer.  Writing on it I don't understand, but I know it's valuable.  You
can have it for ten gold!"

## Option A

Pay for the thing.  You never know.

## Option B

Refuse to pay.  Never trust a Vermling.

***

## B

You laugh and gesture the Vermling away.  You can recognize a low-life swindler
when you see one.  And that piece of garbage was just ... foul.

<strong>No Effect.</strong>
