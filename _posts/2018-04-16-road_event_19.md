Heading down the main road, you see an odd-looking wagon in front of you.
It is covered in metal bars and a number of ragged men in chains walk behind
it.  On either side of the wagon you see city guards on horseback keeping a
watchful eye on everything

You get closer and one of the guards calls out to you.  "Keep your distance!
We are transporting dangerous criminals."

A moment later, one of the prisoners in back slips out of his manacles and begins
to sprint full speed into the tall grass.


## Option A

Help the guards catch the escaping man.

## Option B

Interfere with the guards to help the man escape.

***

## A

The man's speed after spending months in a jail cell is no match for your own.
With the help of the guards on horseback, you quickly have him cornered and
returned to the wagon.
