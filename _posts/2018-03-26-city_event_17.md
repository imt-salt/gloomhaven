## City Event #17
{: .gloomfont}

Returning to Gloomhaven with your latest haul of treasure, you approach the
market in search of a good trade.   Unfortunately, there are only a few visible
stands around that are not yet packing up for the day.

A robed Savvas catches your eye.  It has a few strange artifacts on display, but
you approach with no great expecation, hoping our goods wil fetch a decent price.

The Savvas silently nods as you approach.  It pickes through your haul and lifts
up a single item, holding out a small back for you in exchange.

Pouring out the bag's contents, a single rectangular black-and-white coin lands
in your palm.

## Option A

Demand a different payment.  The single coin is an insult.

## Option B

Accept the strange clin and research it for hidden value.

***

## B

You calmly assess that the coin may possess much more value that it appears to have.
You head to the University and spend hours looking through old records to no avail.
You end the day in a tavern, easing the frustration with a drink and loud laments
about the coin.

"Those markings are very interesting."  You look up to see an Aesther standing over
you.  "They describe a special meeting place.  I can show you where."
