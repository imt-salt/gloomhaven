Walking near the West Gate, you are approached by a scrwny kid in a guard uniform, which is
clearly too big for his small frame.

"Hey, you all are famous!" he says with a big smile.  "I worked as a caravan guard before I
got this job.  Met with a big Inox guy who always talked bout you.  He made you seem like the
nices, most amazing people."

His smile and excitement doesnt' waver.  "Say, my detail is doing some work to repair the wall
damage from the last Vermling attack.  Would you mind helping us?  It'll be fun!"

## Option A

Agree to help the presumptuous kid.

## Option B

Tell this kid that he must have the wrong group of adventurers.

***

## A

It's hard work, but the kid's enthusiasm is infectious.  He wants to know all about your exploits
and adventures, and he and his detail prove to be a great audience.  By the end of the day, it
hardly feels like you've worked at all.
