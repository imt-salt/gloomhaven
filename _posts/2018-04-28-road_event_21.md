You find yourself cutting through the dense underbrush of a forest when you notice
a number of small wooodland animals running along the forest floor in the opposite
direction.

Mice, squirrels, ferrets - they all appear to be running from something up ahead of
you.  You are filled with a troubling sense of foreboding as you catch a whiff of
smoke in the air.


## Option A

Keep moving forward.

## Option B

Follow the animals' cue and run in the opposite direction.

***

## B

Fearing the worst, you turn around and head out of the forest the way you came in.
You reach a clearing just before a great fire consumes everything with its blaze.
It takes a while to orient yourself and find the road again, but considering the
alternative, you feel lucky.
