## Introduction

You reach out to some of your contacts concerning Jekserah’s location, and end up with an
odd bit of information from the Sanctuary of the Great Oak. They say there is a temple high
in the Watcher Mountains dedicated to some unseen force that can answer any questions asked
of it. Visitors must survive the journey and the trials that await inside the temple
first, however.

It is a tradition among the order of the Great Oak to send its members on a pilgrimage to
this temple, where, faced with the prospect of any knowledge they desire, they decline to
ask a question, putting all their trust in the Great Oak instead. The Sanctuary provides
you with some basic directions, and you head off.

While your path is clear, the way is anything but easy. You risk falling to your death
numerous times as you scale the cliff up to the temple. Braving the harsh winds and loose
rocks, you finally reach the top and head through the threshold into a large, open foyer.

“I am afraid I cannot accept visitors at this time,” a disembodied voice booms through
the room. “Please come back in twelve years. I may be able to accommodate you then.”

Before you can object, a group of massive stone constructs materialize before you.

“I know, I know,” the voice says. “You have questions, I have answers. Unfortunately, if
you don’t leave now, you won’t have a head to ask the questions in the first place.”

You ready your weapons. There’s no way you’re going to climb back down that cliff with nothing
to show for it.

## Story Point 1

You open the door to the inner chamber, and more enemies materialize before your eyes.
Flying red lizards, wailing spirits, and great, terrifying bears that don’t seem at all
happy to have been suddenly transported here.

## Conclusion

As the last of the creatures falls, the temple becomes eerily silent. You call out, but the
strange voice offers no response. You begin banging the walls with your weapons and yelling
even louder, making it clear that you will not leave until you have answers.

“ENOUGH!” The power of the voice shakes the ground. “I could easily kill you, you know. But
normally a threat is enough to send you pathetic lesser beings scrambling. I don’t
necessarily like murder, however, so I will make you a deal. I will answer a single question
for you, and then you will leave this place without further incident and never return.

“So what would you like? Great power? (#15) Great wealth? (#17) Or is the location of the necromancer
you are hunting really that important to you?” (#20)
