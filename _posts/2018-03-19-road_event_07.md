## Road Event #07
{: .gloomfont}

Walking along the edge of a forest, you begin to hear strange,
unfamilar sounds coming from beyond the trees.  You stop and listen
closer.

There's a rhythm to the sounds, and with that established, you begin
to pick out different human voices in the mix.  You'd venture to say
that the noise vaguely sounds like chanting.


## Option A

Head into the forest to investigate the chanting.

## Option B

Keep moving down the road.  No need to get mixed up in whatever is going on.

***

## A

You quietly move through the forest toward the noise.  Eventually you come upon
a clearing where you see a circle of cultists performing some strange ritual.
One of them notices you and shouts to the others.  The situation devolves into
a bloody battle.  You are, of course, victorious, but it saps some of your strength.
