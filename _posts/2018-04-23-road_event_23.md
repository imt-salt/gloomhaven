A knapsack and a walking stick on the side of the road catch your attention as you pass.
You look around and see a man squatting in the bushes a small distance away.

"Oh, hello!" he says.  "Good timing, actually.  You wouldn't mind grabbing me some leaves,
would you?  It seems I've made quite a mess over here."


## Option A

Bring the man some leaves.

## Option B

Grab his stuff and run off while he's indisposed.

***

## A

You gather up a handful of leaves and walk over to him.  If you weren't quite sure what
was going on before, the smell definitely confirms it.

"Thanks a lot!" he says cheerily. "Sometimes nature calls, am I right?"

You cough in affirmation and quickly move on.

<strong>No effect.</strong>
