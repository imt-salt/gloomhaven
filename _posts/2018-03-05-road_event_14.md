## Road Event #14
{: .gloomfont}

You are walking down the road when the sound of many wings pulls
your gaze to the sky.  Above you, you see a large flock of white
birds flying southward.

At that height, you figure a well-aimed arrow could bring one of
them down to make a nice meal.


## Option A

Shoot at the birds.

## Option B

Let the birds pass undisturbed.

***

## B

The shot would be difficult, and you'd prefer not to waste the arrow.
You simply move on toward your destination.

<strong>No Effect.</strong>
