## Road Event #18
{: .gloomfont}

The road contains many dangers, and chief among them are the barbaric tribes
of Inox that inhabit the wilderness around the city.  This is why your heart
sinks when you see a mounted group of them ride up to you and surround your
party.

"Ah, agents of that wretched monstrosity you call a town," the largest of the
Inox says as he looks down at you.  "Tell me, scum.  What business do you have
out here on my land?  Have those fools sent you out to murder more of my people?"


## Option A

Attempt to come to a peaceful resolution.

## Option B

Attack the insulting, contemptuous Inox.

***

## B

Enraged by the Inox's insulting tongue, you take up your weapons and attack.
Even the Inox were not expecting a move so bold.  The fight is brutal, especially
with your enemy mounted, but after felling a number of their warriors,
the rest retreat.

<strong>All start scenario with 3 damage.</strong>
