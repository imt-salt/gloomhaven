You decide to head ot the Brown Door for the evening to enjoy a Quatryl concert.

Corruption and crime run rampant in the bar, but the music is unmatched in all of Gloomhaven.

You are enjoying yourself immensely when you catch a glimpse of a man in a dark, tattered
robe near the back of the room.  He appears to be handing vials full of red liquid to a
second man.

## Option A

Further investigate the exchange between the men.

## Option B

Leave the criminal element alone and continue enjoying the show.

***

## A

You subtly move in the direction of the men, monitoring their actions with your peripheral
vision.  You recognize the dark robes from the run-ins you have had with cultists in the area,
and as you get closer, you become convinced that the vials being traded contain blood.  You
grab the men and cause a huge amount of commotion as you fight to drag them outside and foil
their dealings.  You are able to hand them off to the proper authorities, but it may be a
while before you are allowed back in the Brown Door.  The concert was ruined.
