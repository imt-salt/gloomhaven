After a night of heavy drinking, you get turned around while navigating the back alleys
and find yourself standing before a collapsed section of bricked road that leads down
into an underground tunnel.

Fuled by curiosity and bit of liquid courage, you descend in search of adventure.  Stumbling
around in the vast network of tunnels proves rather fuitless, however, until a well-concealed
passage leads you to a long-forgotten stash of weaponry and dried food.

The stuff could fetch a decent price at the Sunken Market, or you could turn it over to the
city guard, which is always in need of arms and rations.

## Option A

Sell the goods.

## Option B

Donate the goods to the city.

***

## B

You sleep off the previous night's revelries and approach the Captain of the Guard.
"This is wonderful news!  With attacks on  the city becoming ever more frequent, our blacksmiths
are having trouble keeping up with our demands.  And the food should help considerably if we
ever find ourselves under siege.  This is truly a big help to the city."
