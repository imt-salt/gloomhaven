A great revelry is underway at the New Market when you arrive to purchase
supplies.  Investigating further, you discover the town is in the midst of
a pie-eating contest.

A group of large sailors sits triumphantly at a long table on a makeshift
stage, cumbs and bits of fruit scattered all around.  A man in the center
stands and addresses the crowd.

"Can no one best our pie-eating prowess?  Step up and test your mettle!"
With nothing better to do, you head up to the stage.

The contest goes well for a while as you match the others pie-for-pie, but
soon your eating starts to slow, and the sailors are still going strong.

## Option A

Yield to the pie and admit defeat.

## Option B

Power through the pain.  You will not be bested!

***

## B

You emit a primal yell and continue eating.  Pie after pie, your willpower
cannot be broken, and eventually the sailors are forced to concede.  However,
 you cannot even stand to shake your foes' hands.  Your legs are boneless, and
 your stomach feels worse than it has ever felt before.  You have earned glory
 and prize money, but all you want to do is lie down and wait for the horror
 to pass.
