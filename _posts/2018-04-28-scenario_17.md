## Introduction

There are many undiscovered islands in the Misty Sea. Most are not worth finding, but still,
you are confident that you will find vast riches on this particular one.

The sea voyage is largely uneventful. You followthesignsuntilyouspyasmallmassof land on the horizon.

It doesn’t get much bigger as you get closer— just a simple piece of earth jutting out of
the water, covered in trees and large rocks. On the opposite side of the island, you see
the remains of a derelict ship. You drop anchor and paddle to dry land.

As your feet hit the sand, an arrow whizzes by your ear and another grazes your leg.
Readying your weapons, you see numerous Vermlings scurrying about in the underbrush, preparing
to attack your position. And then you hear the roar of a bear.

## Story Point 1

Who knew so many of these damned creatures could exist on such a small island? Entering their
dwellings onboard the derelict ship, you see more emerge from the shadows. Along with them,
however, you see the glinting of gold. This tribe has indeed amassed a great wealth in this ship.

## Conclusion

With the distractions of flashing swords and swiping claws put to rest, you investigate
further to find great caches of gold below deck. Who knows what the Vermlings were using
the gold for, but you have a good idea what you will use it for.
