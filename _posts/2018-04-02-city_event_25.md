## City Event #25
{: .gloomfont}

On a trip to the Coin District, you catch sight of an old, wirey Valrath carrying a large,
intricate vase out his front door.

As you get closer, the Valrath begins to struggle with the vase, sweat pouring from his brow.
Under the strain, the Valrath loses his balance, and the fragile vase topples downward as he
yells a string of curses.

## Option A

Attempt to catch the vase.

## Option B

With no time to react, watch the vase fall to the ground.

***

## A

You race forward and wrap your arms around the vase.  You manage to keep grip of it, preventing
tragedy.  The Valrath is relieved and offers to pay you for your trouble if you carry it
the rest of the way.

<strong>Gain 5 collective gold.</strong>
