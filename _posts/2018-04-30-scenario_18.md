## Introduction

From the center of the Silent Bridge, a city guard points you to a grating underneath the west side.
“That’s the best way into that hellhole. Good luck.”

It takes a bit of climbing, but you eventually make your way down to the grate, which has been twisted
and broken over the many years. You light a torch and step inside, following a narrow path up a slight
incline, avoiding the stream of brown liquid running in the opposite direction. After a few minutes,
the path opens up into a series of branching passageways.

You start to look around, deciding on which way to go, when hissing sounds echo through the stonework
toward you. You hold fast to your weapons, straining to see multiple slithering shapes approach.

## Story Point 1

Navigating through the passageways, you find yourself in a large, open room with a cistern in the
center. Around the cistern stand a group of Vermlings, who look up and snarl in your direction. This
must be the cause of the poisoned water.

## Conclusion

The Vermlings lie dead, their dark blood mixing with the pools of water on the floor. Investigating
further, you find no poisons of any kind on the corpses. Is it possible these vermin were not the
cause and instead were just living here, away from the eyes of the guard?  At the back of the room,
large cracks are present in the wall, displaying a passage deeper into the depths. (#23)

And if you had some way to breathe underwater, (#14) (#43) you may even be able to enter the cistern
and find the source that way. (#26)
