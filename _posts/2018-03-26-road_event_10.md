## Road Event #10
{: .gloomfont}

You have only just wandered off the main road in search of your destination when the
ground begins to shift beneath your feet.

What was once solid now gives way, and you find yourself falling down into a dark pit.
You land twenty feet down, cushioned by the soil that fell with you.

You stand up with alertness and look around, trying to get your bearings.  You have
fallen into a man made cavern with smooth stone walls and floors.

This could be a trap or just some long-forgotten structure.


## Option A

Use weights and ropes to climb out of the hole as quickly as possible.

## Option B

Explore the area.

***

## B

Lighting a torch, you see a number of passages leading out of the stone room.
Unfazed, you head down one of them and begin exploring the network of chambers.
In one, you find a pedistal and sitting atop that, a small, metal sphere.

You take the strange sphere and continue your search, but the only other remarkable
thing you find is an exit.
