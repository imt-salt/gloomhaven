You are feeling a tad hungry as you walk down the road.  You are considering
stopping for a meal when you come across a thicket of bushes covered in red berries.

The berries look delicious, but you hesitate.  They could be poisonous.


## Option A

Eat the berries.

## Option B

Pass by the berries and just eat your normal rations.

***

## B

Not wanting to regret making a stupid decision, you refrain from eating the berries
and continue on down the road.

<strong>No effect.</strong>
