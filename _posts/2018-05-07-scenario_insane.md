# #Insanity
{: .gloomfont}

__Requirements:__ None <br>
__Goal:__ Kill all enemies <br>

## Introduction

We thought we would practice using some of the new characters we had unlocked and just have a fun
night.  We somewhat randomly chose a couple of monsters and placed them on a map we had thrown
together.  Little did we realize, most of the mosters summon other monster types.  We were quickly
overrun.

## Conclusion

Exhausted and exhilerated, we cleared the last room and took down The Sightless Eye.  This was
going to be the last time we would be able to get together as a group in person for quite some time.
This was ended up being a really fun, if hard, challenge for us.
