## #14

You hear screams from the south as you approach the docks and see a group of
women running towards you in panic.

"An invasion!" They yell as the race by you, nearly knocking you over.

You hurry to the docks and find a crowd of workers on edge, armed with makeshift
weapons and circling one particular pier.

Standing at the far edge of the wooden planks is a group of Lurkers -- terrifying
crab-like monsters as big as an Inox and equally ferocious.  Except these Lurkers
don't appear to be hostile.  They are simply standing on the dock, clacking their
claws in a strange rhythm.

## Option A

Raise arms and fight the Lurkers back into the sea.

## Option B

Approach the Lurkers cautiously and attempt to communicate with them.

***

## A

The crowd parts as you approach the dock with weapons drawn.  You step onto the soft
wood and the Lurkers turn towards you and stop clacking.  They all hiss and brandish
their claws in aggression.  You charge forward and meet the threat head-on, hacking away
at their carapaces until the scuttle off the dock and back into the water.
